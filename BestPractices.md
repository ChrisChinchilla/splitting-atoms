# Best Practices

A collection of best practices when developing for Atom. It is early and
everyone is still learning, so everything is fair game!

This document is for general best practices when it comes to using Atom,
developing with Atom, and developing for Atom. We also have separate
collections of best practices for the following more specific topics:

- [Best Practices When Developing Packages](PackageGuides/BestPractices.md)
- [Best Practices When Developing Themes](ThemeGuides/BestPractices.md)
- [Best Practices When Configuring Atom](ConfigurationGuides/BestPractices/md)

Only if a best practice doesn't belong in one of the above categories should
it be included below.
