A collection of best practices when developing for Atom. It is early and
everyone is still learning, so everything is fair game!

This document is for general best practices when it comes to using Atom,

- [Best Practices When Developing Themes](ThemeGuides/BestPractices.html)
- [Best Practices When Configuring Atom](ConfigurationGuides/BestPractices.html)
