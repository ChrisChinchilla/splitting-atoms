# GIFCasting

Making animated GIFs to demonstrate your incredible Atom package or reproduce a
~~bug~~ feature is a great way to demonstrate how something works, rather than
telling.

## LICEcap

[LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) makes creating animated gifs super
easy. If you're on a Mac, download the DMG, install it and run it from the
Applications menu.

Once up you get a re-sizable window that you can record with. After clicking
record, LICEcap asks you where you want to save the resulting gif and gives you
a pre-roll to get ready for the recording.

Make sure to make your motions slowly (or very obviously) so that people can
detect what you're doing.

If you make mistakes it's ok. Either roll with it or just do it over again.
You are human after all (unless you're a Hubot).
