Splitting Atoms is a community-built, community-driven guide to hacking on the
[Atom](https://atom.io) editor.

Atom is

> A hackable text editor for the 21st Century

> At GitHub, we're building the text editor we've always wanted. A tool you can customize to do anything, but also use productively on the first day without ever touching a config file. Atom is modern, approachable, and hackable to the core. We can't wait to see what you build with it.

The aim of Splitting Atoms is to build a collection of useful guides, best
practices, and tips and tricks for hacking on Atom. We want to make it easy for anyone to sit down in front of Atom and start developing interesting things
right away. We also want to help push Atom to its limits.

## Who is behind this?

Splitting Atoms is built and maintained by [Josh Branchaud](http://joshbranchaud.com) and many [awesome contributors](https://github.com/jbranchaud/splitting-atoms/graphs/contributors).
