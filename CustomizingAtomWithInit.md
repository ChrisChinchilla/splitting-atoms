# Customizing Atom With init.coffee

Your Atom dotfile (`~/.atom`) comes with an initialization file (`init.coffee`)
that can be used for all sorts of programmatic customizations to the editor.
This file is evaluated each time you open a new window.

- customize configuration settings for certain types of files (say, based on
the extension of the file)
- define custom commands to make yourself more efficient
- create macros that will execute a series of common commands

There is quite a bit that is possible here. This is a great way to quickly
add to your Atom toolbelt without writing a full-blown package.

*We will also maintain a list of useful, clever, and popular init
customizations*
