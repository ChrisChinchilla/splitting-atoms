  This is a guide built by the Atom community, for the Atom community. This guide aims to be approachable for newcomers so that they can get up to speed and hacking on Atom in no time. It will also provide content, such as best practices and advanced guides, that will engage developers who have already been knee deep in the Atom API. Developing clever packages, creating beautiful themes, and tweaking your configuration until it is just right are all covered. Check out the best practices for improving upon what you have already built. See the tips and tricks section to make sure you are taking full advantage of what Atom can do.

  Atom is in beta so it is rough around the edges, but also changing and improving rapidly. This guide will do its best to keep up. If content is missing or outdated, then lend a hand and write a section or a guide.
