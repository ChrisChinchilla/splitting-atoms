# Package Guides

A collection of community-built guides on developing different kinds of
packages for Atom. These guides will show you how to take advantage of
various parts of Atom's API.

The Atom docs offer a guide on
[creating your first package](https://atom.io/docs/latest/your-first-package),
a package that replaces the selected text with ascii art.

The Atom docs also offer a more general guide to
[creating a package](https://atom.io/docs/latest/creating-a-package).

## Creating a new package guide

To create a new package guide, simply fork this repository, create a new
markdown file in this directory with a helpful name, and then start writing.

In general, one should try to keep the packages and, thus, the guides
relatively simple, though guides for larger, more complex packages are also
welcome.

*Style guide to follow, for now, use your best judgement!*
