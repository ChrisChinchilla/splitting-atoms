# Coffeescript Primer

A quick primer on coffeescript for those that want to develop a Atom
package, but don't have much experience with coffeescript. This guide
assumes you have programming experience, though not with coffeescript, and
aims to give you enough of a foundation to hack on existing packages and
create your own simple packages.

As a reference and for a quick overview of the coffeescript syntax, see
[coffeescript.org](http://coffeescript.org/).
