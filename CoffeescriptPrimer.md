title:  CoffeeScript Primer
---

A quick primer on CoffeeScript for those that want to develop a Atom
package, but don't have much experience with CoffeeScript. This guide
assumes you have programming experience, though not with CoffeeScript, and
aims to give you enough of a foundation to hack on existing packages and
create your own simple packages.

As a reference and for a quick overview of the CoffeeScript syntax, see
[coffeescript.org](http://coffeescript.org/). From there you can also
check out the [CoffeeScript Cookbook](http://coffeescriptcookbook.com/).
