## Assigning Keybindings For Your Package

The commands that your package defines are the main interface through which users of your package will access or invoke certain features. As always, these can be accessed from the command palette. For some commands though, that are accessed very frequently during development, accessing them through the command palette can be too much friction. This is where keybindings can come into play.

Mapping a combination of keys to a certain piece of functionality in your package can be a good way to make a useful feature that much easier to access or invoke. Keybindings are great ways to enhance a package, but abusing and overusing them can quickly result in a pollution of the keybinding space with packages stepping on one another toes and perhaps those of Atom's core functionality as well. Only once you are certain that a particular command deserves a keybinding should you add it.
