Splitting Atoms is a community-built, community-driven guide to hacking on
GitHub's new code editor, [Atom](https://atom.io). If Atom is in beta, then you can consider Splitting Atoms
to be in alpha. Rest assured, myself and a bunch of fantastic contributors
are hard at working filling in the gaps right now.

In the meantime, we would love your [feedback via issues](https://github.com/jbranchaud/splitting-atoms/issues?state=open). If you have some Atom knowledge to share, also consider writing a guide or expanding and fixing content in other parts of the site.
