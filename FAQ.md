## Why coffeescript?

Using coffeescript and CSON is a matter of preference and readability as well as compatability with EC6.

## Is coffeescript required for developing plugins?

JavaScript and JSON can be used in Atom packages, there is no requirement to write a single line of CoffeeScript or CSON to make an Atom package.
