## Why Coffeescript?

Using coffeescript and CSON is a matter of preference and readability as well as compatability with EC6.

[See the discussion](http://discuss.atom.io/t/why-coffeescript/131)

## Is Coffeescript required for developing plugins?

JavaScript and JSON can be used in Atom packages, there is no requirement to write a single line of CoffeeScript or CSON to make an Atom package.

In Atom any `.coffee`/`.cson`/`.less` files can always be `.js`/`.json`/`.css` files instead.
