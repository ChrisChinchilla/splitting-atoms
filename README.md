# Splitting Atoms

a community-built guide to hacking on the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor

> A hackable text editor for the 21st Century

> At GitHub, we're building the text editor we've always wanted. A tool you
> can customize to do anything, but also use productively on the first day
> without ever touching a config file. Atom is modern, approachable, and
> hackable to the core. We can't wait to see what you build with it.

To find out more about Atom from the team itself, read
[Introducing Atom](http://blog.atom.io/2014/02/26/introducing-atom.html) and
[The Nucleus of Atom](http://blog.atom.io/2014/02/26/the-nucleus-of-atom.html).

## Getting Started

You can start by going through
[the official Atom documentation](https://atom.io/docs) which contains a
handful of helpful guides for creating packages and themes as well as
advanced topics such as configuring your environment.

Check out the [Atom API](http://atom.io/docs/api) for more detailed
documentation on the APIs that are available to those developing packages or
hacking on existing ones.
