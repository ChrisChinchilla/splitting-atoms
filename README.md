# Splitting Atoms

a community-built guide to hacking on the [Atom](https://atom.io) editor

> A hackable text editor for the 21st Century

> At GitHub, we're building the text editor we've always wanted. A tool you
> can customize to do anything, but also use productively on the first day
> without ever touching a config file. Atom is modern, approachable, and
> hackable to the core. We can't wait to see what you build with it.
